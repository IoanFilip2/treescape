\usage{
plotTreeDiff(tr1, tr2, vec1 = NULL, vec2 = NULL, baseCol = "grey",
  col1 = "peachpuff", col2 = "red2", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{tr1}{an object of the class \code{phylo}: the first tree to plot}

\item{tr2}{an object of the class \code{phylo}: the second tree to plot}

\item{vec1}{an optional input, the result of \code{treeVec(tr1, lambda=0)}, to speed up the computation}

\item{vec2}{an optional input, the result of \code{treeVec(tr2, lambda=0)}, to speed up the computation}

\item{baseCol}{the colour used for tips with identical ancestry in the two trees. Defaults to "grey".}

\item{col1}{the first colour used to define the colour spectrum for tips with differences. This colour will be used for tips with minor differences. Defaults to "peachpuff".}

\item{col2}{the second colour used to define the colour spectrum for tips with differences. This colour will be used for tips with major differences. Defaults to "red2".}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to \code{\link{plot.phylo}}}
}
\value{
A plot of the two trees side by side. Tips are coloured in the following way:
\itemize{
\item if each ancestor of a tip in tree 1 occurs in tree 2 with the same partition of tip descendants, then the tip is coloured grey (or supplied "baseCol")
\item if not, the tip gets coloured pale orange to red on a scale according to how many differences there are amongst its most recent common ancestors with other tips. The colour spectrum can be changed according to preference.
}
}
\description{
Highlight the topologicial differences between two trees, plotted side by side. 
This function is useful for comparing representative "median" trees - see \code{\link{medTree}}.
}
\examples{
## simple example on trees with five tips:
tr1 <- read.tree(text="((A:1,B:1):1,((C:1,D:1):1,E:1):1):1;")
tr2 <- read.tree(text="((A:1,B:1):1,(C:1,(D:1,E:1):1):1):1;")
plotTreeDiff(tr1,tr2)

## example on larger woodmice trees
data(woodmiceTrees)
plotTreeDiff(woodmiceTrees[[1]],woodmiceTrees[[2]])
## change aesthetics:
plotTreeDiff(woodmiceTrees[[1]],woodmiceTrees[[2]], 
   baseCol="grey2", col1="cyan", col2="navy", 
   edge.width=2, type="radial", cex=0.5, font=2)
