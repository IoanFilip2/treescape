# Notes and examples for the three key metric functions
# (I assume they will all be grouped together to form one neat function in the 
# end, but I wasn't sure of the best way to do that.)

# For every tree, we compute two MRCA vectors, vt and vl, where vt is the 
# "topological" version where we count edges, and vl is the lengths version.
# We also create a vector p of the pendant branch lengths. 
# Then the tree is assigned the vector
# c((1-lambda)*vt + lambda*vl, lambda*p),
# where lambda is a variable in [0,1] chosen by the user, so that when 
# lambda=0 we are only detecting topology, and when lambda=1 we are focused on
# lengths. The user can choose whether to submit a value of lambda or to
# leave lambda as a variable so that the function can be evaluated later for
# a range of different lambda.

# tree.vec takes a single phylo object as input, with optional parameters
# lambda=0, type="number", and outputs the mrca vector
# Examples:
mytree <- rtree(6)
tree.vec(mytree) # vector of toplogical mrca distances from root. We suppress 
                # the final 6 entries for p which would all be 0 because lambda=0
tree.vec(mytree,0.5)
mt1 <- tree.vec(mytree,type="function") # outputs a function of lambda
mt1(0.5) # evaluate the mrca vector for lambda = 0.5 (Equal to tree.vec(mytree,0.5))

# tree.dist takes two phylo objects as input, with optional parameters as above,
# and outputs their mrca distance
# Examples:
mytree1 <- rtree(6); mytree2 <- rtree(6)
tree.dist(mytree1,mytree2) # topological distance
tree.dist(mytree1,mytree2,1) # lengths distance
mt2 <- tree.dist(mytree1,mytree2,type="function") # function of lambda
mt2(0) # evaluate at lambda=0, equivalent to tree.dist(mytree1,mytree2).
require(base)
plot(sapply(seq(0,1,length.out=100), function(x) mt2(x)), type="l") # examine
      # how the distance changes when moving from focus on topology to length

# multi.dist takes a multiPhylo object, same parameters again, and outputs the
# full distance matrix of pairwise distances between trees
# Examples:
mytrees <- rmtree(8,6)
multi.dist(mytrees) # topological distance matrix
mtm <- multi.dist(mytrees, type="function") # matrix function of lambda
mtm(0) # evaluate at lambda=0, equivalent to multi.dist(mytrees)
